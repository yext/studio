# Developer Guide

The "developer" persona is a person that in most cases would prefer to write code than use the Studio UI itself for editing a site.
A developer is also the person who would go into a particular Studio theme (template?) and create components for admins to use.
A developer would also be the one who writes plugins that extend Studio that maybe adds components or certain types of props.

For a page using Studio, for the most part developers can treat the source code as if it was a regular typescript react project,
with a few caveats.

## Editing the source code for a site

1. Folder structure
  - src/pages
  - src/components
  - src/layouts
  - siteSettings.ts
