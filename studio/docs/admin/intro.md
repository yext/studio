# Admin Guide

The admin person is a user who would use Studio almost exclusively through the provided UI, avoiding touching code when possible.

Here is a current list of capabilities an admin has:

1. Adding components
2. Editing component props
3. Editing site settings contents
4. Rearranging components
5. Removing components

In the future they should also be able to 

1. Add pages
2. Delete pages
3. Update page names/URLs
