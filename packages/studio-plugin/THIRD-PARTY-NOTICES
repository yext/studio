   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# @rollup/plugin-inject

🍣 A Rollup plugin which scans modules for global variables and injects `import` statements where necessary.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/plugin-inject --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:

```js
import inject from '@rollup/plugin-inject';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'output',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [
    inject({
      Promise: ['es6-promise', 'Promise']
    })
  ]
};
```

Then call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).

This configuration above will scan all your files for global Promise usage and plugin will add import to desired module (`import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'` in this case).

Examples:

```js
{
  // import { Promise } from 'es6-promise'
  Promise: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import { Promise as P } from 'es6-promise'
  P: [ 'es6-promise', 'Promise' ],

  // import $ from 'jquery'
  $: 'jquery',

  // import * as fs from 'fs'
  fs: [ 'fs', '*' ],

  // use a local module instead of a third-party one
  'Object.assign': path.resolve( 'src/helpers/object-assign.js' ),
}
```

Typically, `@rollup/plugin-inject` should be placed in `plugins` _before_ other plugins so that they may apply optimizations, such as dead code removal.

## Options

In addition to the properties and values specified for injecting, users may also specify the options below.

### `exclude`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should _ignore_. By default no files are ignored.

### `include`

Type: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>
Default: `null`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.

# @rollup/pluginutils

A set of utility functions commonly used by 🍣 Rollup plugins.

## Requirements

The plugin utils require an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v14.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/pluginutils --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
import utils from '@rollup/pluginutils';
//...
```

## API

Available utility functions are listed below:

_Note: Parameter names immediately followed by a `?` indicate that the parameter is optional._

### addExtension

Adds an extension to a module ID if one does not exist.

Parameters: `(filename: String, ext?: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

```js
import { addExtension } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    resolveId(code, id) {
      // only adds an extension if there isn't one already
      id = addExtension(id); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
      id = addExtension(id, '.myext'); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
    }
  };
}
```

### attachScopes

Attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.

Parameters: `(ast: Node, propertyName?: String)`<br>
Returns: `Object`

See [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.

```js
import { attachScopes } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      let scope = attachScopes(ast, 'scope');

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = node.scope;

          if (!scope.contains('foo')) {
            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,
            // we assume it's a global
          }
        },
        leave(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = scope.parent;
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### createFilter

Constructs a filter function which can be used to determine whether or not certain modules should be operated upon.

Parameters: `(include?: <picomatch>, exclude?: <picomatch>, options?: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `include` and `exclude`

Type: `String | RegExp | Array[...String|RegExp]`<br>

A valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features) pattern, or array of patterns. If `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match one or more of the `picomatch` patterns, and must not match any of the `options.exclude` patterns.

Note that `picomatch` patterns are very similar to [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#readme) patterns, and in most use cases, they are interchangeable. If you have more specific pattern matching needs, you can view [this comparison table](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#library-comparisons) to learn more about where the libraries differ.

#### `options`

##### `resolve`

Type: `String | Boolean | null`

Optionally resolves the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`. If a `String` is specified, then the value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.

#### Usage

```js
import { createFilter } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  // assume that the myPlugin accepts options of `options.include` and `options.exclude`
  var filter = createFilter(options.include, options.exclude, {
    resolve: '/my/base/dir'
  });

  return {
    transform(code, id) {
      if (!filter(id)) return;

      // proceed with the transformation...
    }
  };
}
```

### dataToEsm

Transforms objects into tree-shakable ES Module imports.

Parameters: `(data: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `data`

Type: `Object`

An object to transform into an ES module.

#### Usage

```js
import { dataToEsm } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

const esModuleSource = dataToEsm(
  {
    custom: 'data',
    to: ['treeshake']
  },
  {
    compact: false,
    indent: '\t',
    preferConst: false,
    objectShorthand: false,
    namedExports: true
  }
);
/*
Outputs the string ES module source:
  export const custom = 'data';
  export const to = ['treeshake'];
  export default { custom, to };
*/
```

### extractAssignedNames

Extracts the names of all assignment targets based upon specified patterns.

Parameters: `(param: Node)`<br>
Returns: `Array[...String]`

#### `param`

Type: `Node`

An `acorn` AST Node.

#### Usage

```js
import { extractAssignedNames } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.type === 'VariableDeclarator') {
            const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);
            // do something with the declared names
            // e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ...` => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']
          }
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### makeLegalIdentifier

Constructs a bundle-safe identifier from a `String`.

Parameters: `(str: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { makeLegalIdentifier } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

makeLegalIdentifier('foo-bar'); // 'foo_bar'
makeLegalIdentifier('typeof'); // '_typeof'
```

### normalizePath

Converts path separators to forward slash.

Parameters: `(filename: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { normalizePath } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

normalizePath('foo\\bar'); // 'foo/bar'

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

[![Saucelabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/gh-indutny-elliptic.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/gh-indutny-elliptic)

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## Benchmarks

```bash
$ node benchmarks/index.js
Benchmarking: sign

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - esm-module-paths@1.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# esm-module-paths

ESM modules don't allow to use [`__dirname`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_dirname) and [`__filename`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_filename) do determine a `.js` file's location.
Instead, you need to copy/paste [multiple lines and expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50052194) each time to achieve the same.

This package makes this a bit easier.

## Usage

Imagine a file in `./your/path/index.js`

```js
import { getModulePaths } from "esm-module-paths";

const { __dirname, __filename } = getModulePaths();

console.log(__dirname); // /your/path
console.log(__filename); // /your/path/index.js
```

For convenience reasons, the library also exports `__filename` and `__dirname` as functions, which can be used independently.

```js
import { __filename, __dirname } from "esm-module-paths";

console.log(__dirname()); // /your/path
console.log(__filename()); // /your/path/index.js
```

Since `__dirname` and `__filename` being functions may be confusing to some, especially since those used to be variables, this package also exports aliased, more descriptive versions of each function.

```js
import { getFileName, getDirName } from "esm-module-paths";

console.log(getDirName()); // /your/path
console.log(getFileName()); // /your/path/index.js
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install esm-module-paths
```

or

```sh
yarn add esm-module-paths
```

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

definitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated
in v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).

# Installation

Use your favourite package manager:

-  [npm](https://npmjs.org): `npm install simple-git`
-  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add simple-git`

# System Dependencies

Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed and that it can be called using the command `git`.

# Usage

Include into your JavaScript app using common js:

```javascript
// require the library, main export is a function
const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(simpleGit.CleanOptions.FORCE);

// or use named properties
const { simpleGit, CleanOptions } = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include into your JavaScript app as an ES Module:

```javascript
import { simpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include in a TypeScript app using the bundled type definitions:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

## Configuration

Configure each `simple-git` instance with a properties object passed to the main `simpleGit` function:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, SimpleGitOptions } from 'simple-git';

const options: Partial<SimpleGitOptions> = {
   baseDir: process.cwd(),
   binary: 'git',
   maxConcurrentProcesses: 6,
   trimmed: false,
};

// when setting all options in a single object
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit(options);

// or split out the baseDir, supported for backward compatibility
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { binary: 'git' });
```

The first argument can be either a string (representing the working directory for `git` commands to run in),
`SimpleGitOptions` object or `undefined`, the second parameter is an optional `SimpleGitOptions` object.

All configuration properties are optional, the default values are shown in the example above.

## Per-command Configuration

To prefix the commands run by `simple-git` with custom configuration not saved in the git config (ie: using the
`-c` command) supply a `config` option to the instance builder:

```typescript
// configure the instance with a custom configuration property
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { config: ['http.proxy=someproxy'] });

// any command executed will be prefixed with this config
// runs: git -c http.proxy=someproxy pull
await git.pull();
```

## Configuring Plugins

- [AbortController](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ABORT-CONTROLLER.md)
   Terminate pending and future tasks in a `simple-git` instance (requires node >= 16).

- [Completion Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-COMPLETION-DETECTION.md)
   Customise how `simple-git` detects the end of a `git` process.

- [Error Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ERRORS.md)
   Customise the detection of errors from the underlying `git` process.

- [Progress Events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md)
   Receive progress events as `git` works through long-running processes.

- [Spawned Process Ownership](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-SPAWN-OPTIONS.md)
   Configure the system `uid` / `gid` to use for spawned `git` processes.

- [Timeout](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-TIMEOUT.md)
   Automatically kill the wrapped `git` process after a rolling timeout.

- [Unsafe](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-UNSAFE-ACTIONS.md)
   Selectively opt out of `simple-git` safety precautions - for advanced users and use cases.

## Using Task Promises

Each task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each
step in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a
`Promise` chain.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();

// chain together tasks to await final result
await git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');

// or await each step individually
await git.init();
await git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');
```

### Catching errors in async code

To catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init();
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}
```

or catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than
jumping to the final `catch` on the first error:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}

function ignoreError() {}
```

## Using Task Callbacks

In addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument
to handle the result of the task.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
git.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);

function onInit(err, initResult) {}
function onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}
```

If any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the
[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .

## Task Responses

Whether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the
`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.

For type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).

## changing the working directory [examples](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/examples/git-change-working-directory.md)

-  `.cwd(workingDirectory)` Sets the working directory for all future commands - note, this will change the working for the root instance, any chain created from the root will also be changed.
-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).

## How to Specify Options

Where the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which
will all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.

### Options as an Object

When the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value
pair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });

// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'
git.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });
```

### Options as an Array

Options can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands
in the same way as when an object is used:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);
```

# Release History

Major release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as
with TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your
application hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.

See also:

- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)
- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)

# Concurrent / Parallel Requests

When the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful
for when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:

```typescript
simpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();
```

Each task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a
step of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.

When the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained
off another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful
for when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit();
const results = await Promise.all([
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),
]);
function swallow(err) {
   return null;
}
```

Each `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and
manages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the
`simpleGit` function, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });
```

Treating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of
`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.

# Complex Requests

When no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly
using `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:

```javascript
const path = '/path/to/repo';
const commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];

// using an array of commands and node-style callback
simpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {
   // err is null unless this command failed
   // result is the raw output of this command
});

// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback
const result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);

// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses
const result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);
```

# Authentication

The easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:

```javascript
const USER = 'something';
const PASS = 'somewhere';
const REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';

const remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;

simpleGit()
   .clone(remote)
   .then(() => console.log('finished'))
   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));
```

Be sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication
to ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.

# Environment Variables

Pass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which
supports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:

```javascript
const GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';

simpleGit()
   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)
   .status((err, status) => {
      /*  */
   });

simpleGit()
   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })
   .status()
   .then((status) => {})
   .catch((err) => {});
```

Note - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`
variables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.

# Exception Handling

When the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a
successful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no
available parser to handle the error or a
`GitResponseError` for when there is.

See the `err` property of the callback:

```javascript
git.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {
   if (err.git) {
      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary
   }
});
```

Catch errors with try/catch in async code:

```javascript
try {
   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

Catch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:

```javascript
const mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {
   if (err.git) {
      return err.git;
   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary
   throw err; // some other error, so throw
});

if (mergeSummary.failed) {
   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

With typed errors available in TypeScript

```typescript
import { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';
try {
   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content
   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;
   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

# Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Enable logging

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md) for logging examples and how to
make use of the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library's programmatic interface
in your application.

### Enable Verbose Logging

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for
the full list of verbose logging options to use with the
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.

### Every command returns ENOENT error message

There are a few potential reasons:

-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used
   with the `.customBinary(...)` api option.

-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible
   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses
   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,
   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:

   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`

### Log format fails

The properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending
on the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version
before that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you
are using.

For more details of the supported tokens, please see the
[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)

### Log response properties are out of order

The properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages
use this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`

### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files

-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`
-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)
-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal
-  Check the language used in the response is english locale

In some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for
`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.

### Legacy Node Versions

From `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will
result in errors such as:

-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`
-  `Object.entries is not a function`
-  `message.flatMap is not a function`

To resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills
from `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).

# Examples

### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task

If the `simple-git` api doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to
be added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, pathspec } from "simple-git";

const git = simpleGit();
const wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();
const subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);
const subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });
```

### async await

```javascript
async function status(workingDir) {
   let statusSummary = null;
   try {
      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();
   } catch (e) {
      // handle the error
   }

   return statusSummary;
}

// using the async function
status(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));
```

### Initialise a git repo if necessary

```javascript
const git = simpleGit(__dirname);

git.checkIsRepo()
   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))
   .then(() => git.fetch());

function initialiseRepo(git) {
   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));
}
```

### Update repo and get a list of tags

```javascript
simpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')
   .pull()
   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));

// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app
simpleGit().pull((err, update) => {
   if (update && update.summary.changes) {
      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
   }
});
```

### Starting a new repo

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .init()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')
   .push('origin', 'master');
```

### push with `-u`

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')
   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));
```

### Piping to the console for long-running tasks

See [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on
logging progress updates.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit({
   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {
      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);
   },
});
git.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');
```

### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app

```javascript
// when using a chain
simpleGit()
   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))
   .pull((err, update) => {
      if (update && update.summary.changes) {
         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
      }
   })
   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));

// when using async and optional chaining
const git = simpleGit();
console.log('Starting pull...');
if ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {
   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
}
console.log('pull done.');
```

### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags

```javascript
console.log(await simpleGit().log());
console.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));
```

### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')
   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')
   .commit('committed as "Some One"', 'file-one')
   .commit('committed as "Another Person"', 'file-two', {
      '--author': '"Another Person <another@person.com>"',
   });
```

### Get remote repositories

```javascript
simpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {
   if (!err) {
      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');
      console.log(data);
   }
});
```
