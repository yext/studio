	"c_biography": "\u003cscript\u003e  some stuff 2\u003c/script\u003e Joe Exotic was born Joseph Allen Schreibvogel in Garden City, Kansas, on March 5, 1963.[6][7][8], to parents Francis and Shirley Schreibvogel.[9] He grew up on a working farm in Kansas. \u003cscript\u003e  some ampersand stuff \u0026 \u0026 \u003c/script\u003e He was Joseph Allen Schreibvogel in Garden City, Kansas. When he was five years old, he was, allegedly, raped by an older boy.[1]  He and his family moved to Texas, where he joined the Eastvale, Texas, police department, soon becoming chief of the small department. He has said that after being outed to his parents as a homosexual by one of his siblings, he attempted suicide by crashing his police cruiser into a bridge.[2] His claims about the wreck have changed over time: in 1997, he told The Dallas Morning News that someone forced the car off the bridge during a police drug investigation. Local residents who were contacted had no recollection of the event.[3]\n\nAnimals\nExotic worked at various jobs before opening a pet shop with his brother Garold in Arlington, Texas, in 1986.[2] In 1997, after closing the first pet shop and opening a new one nearby, Exotic came into conflict with Arlington officials over repeated code violations for decorations and signs: he had been hanging gay pride symbols such as a United States flag with rainbow stripes in the shop windows; he accused city inspectors of homophobia and of targeting the business because of his sexual orientation.[3] After his brother's death in a car accident in 1997, Exotic sold the pet shop and purchased a 16-acre (6.5 ha) Oklahoma farm with his parents.[2][3] Two years after his brother's death, the farm opened as Garold Wayne Exotic Animal Memorial Park in dedication to his brother.[2][10] Two of Garold's pets were the zoo's first inhabitants.[2]\n\nIn February 1999, animal welfare investigators discovered a large number of neglected emus in Red Oak, Texas, and Exotic volunteered to capture the animals and take them to his animal park. However, Exotic, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Exotic and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered livestock, they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a grand jury declined to indict Exotic. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.[3]\n\nIn 2000, Exotic acquired his first two tigers, which had been abandoned.[2] To feed his growing zoo of big cats, he took in horses that were donated to him. He would shoot the horses and feed them whole to the tigers, lions, and other big cats.[1]\n\nFor over 20 years he was known as Joe Exotic, the owner and operator of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park (a.k.a. G.W. Zoo), known for its big cats. He operated an online reality television show that he streamed from his zoo. Over the years, he operated sideshows around the country, allowing people to pet tiger cubs. He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls.[11]\n\nIn 2006, the G.W. Zoo was cited multiple times by the USDA for violations of Animal Welfare Act standards.[12] In 2011, Carole Baskin, founder of Big Cat Rescue sanctuary in Florida, organized protests against his use of cubs in his shows. To retaliate, Exotic used the Big Cat Rescue name and various identifying aspects of the sanctuary's branding in his own marketing. Baskin sued Exotic for trademark infringement and eventually was ruled to be entitled to $1 million in settlement compensation from him, although she was unable to collect most of it.[11]\n\nIn 2021, Exotic stated that his whole outlook on animals in captivity has changed while he's been in jail, and he now believes that \"no animal belongs in a cage\". He also said that he would've never had a zoo if he knew what life inside a cage was like 20 years ago.[13]\n\nMusic\nSee also: ยง Discography\nDuring his career as a zoo owner, Exotic was also an aspiring country singer. Under the pretense of obtaining music for a planned reality television series, he commissioned country songs from other artists, with his creative contributions reportedly being limited to suggesting song topics and singing some backing vocals. He produced music videos for the songs and posted them on his YouTube channel, depicting himself as the main performer and taking full credit for the music, allegedly without having notified the actual artists.[14]\n\nIn 2015, he released a video for the song \"Here Kitty Kitty\", a diss track against Carole Baskin. In the video, he had a Baskin lookalike feeding her second husband, Don Lewis, to the tigers. Lewis has been missing since 1997,[15] and was declared legally dead in 2002.[16] This song was humorously covered by the band The Offspring after the release of Tiger King. Another well-known song by Exotic is \"I Saw A Tiger\", which has been covered by numerous bands and artists.[17][18]\n\nBibliography\nOn March 3rd, 2021, Exotic announced his autobiography Tiger King: The Official Tell-All Memoir, which will be released on November 9th.[19][20][21][22][23] In prison, Exotic is allowed to use a computer for 30 minutes at a time, so has been working on his book every day.[24]\n\nPolitics\nExotic, running as Joseph Allen Maldonado, ran as an independent candidate in the 2016 election for President of the United States, attaining ballot access in Colorado and receiving 962 votes (including recorded write-ins) nationwide.[25]\n\nHe then ran as Joe Exotic in the 2018 Libertarian Party primary election for Governor of Oklahoma. He received 664 votes in the primary, finishing last among the three Libertarian candidates.[26][27][11] During his primary campaign, he was officially censured by the Oklahoma Libertarian Party.[28] In 2019, following his arrest, the state convention voted unanimously to revoke his party membership.[29]\n\n\nInitial primary results by county:\nChris Powell\nPowell/Lawhorn tie\nRex L.
